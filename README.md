- Deployment Service: `https://dot-clar-ipfs.onrender.com/api/deploy`

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Modern web browser
- Stacks wallet (for deployment features)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd solidity-clarity-converter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

### Environment Variables
```env
REACT_APP_CONVERSION_API=https://satoshiscript-ai.onrender.com
REACT_APP_DEPLOYMENT_API=https://dot-clar-ipfs.onrender.com
```

## 📱 Smart Contract Address

**Testnet Deployments:**
- Network: Stacks Testnet
- Contract addresses are generated dynamically upon deployment
- View deployed contracts at: [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co/?chain=testnet)

## 🎯 How to Use the Project

### 1. **Convert Solidity to Clarity**
   - Paste your Solidity smart contract code in the left editor
   - Click "Convert to Clarity" button
   - Wait for AI processing (usually 10-30 seconds)
   - Review the converted Clarity code in the right editor

### 2. **Understand the Conversion**
   - Read the detailed explanation provided below the editors
   - Understand how Solidity patterns were converted to Clarity equivalents
   - Learn about the differences between the two languages

### 3. **Deploy to Stacks**
   - Connect your Stacks wallet
   - Click "Commit Changes" on the Clarity editor
   - Enter a repository name for your contract
   - Confirm deployment to Stacks testnet/mainnet

### 4. **Example Conversion**
   ```solidity
   // Solidity Input
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   
   contract SimpleStorage {
       uint256 private storedData;
       
       function set(uint256 x) public {
           storedData = x;
       }
       
       function get() public view returns (uint256) {
           return storedData;
       }
   }
   ```

   ```clarity
   ;; Clarity Output
   (define-data-var stored-data uint u0)
   
   (define-public (set (x uint))
     (begin
       (var-set stored-data x)
       (ok x)))
   
   (define-read-only (get)
     (var-get stored-data))
   ```
